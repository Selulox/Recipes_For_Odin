                <li>Melt the butter in a large lidded saucepan, add the onion, leeks and potatoes with a good pinch of salt and toss them in the butter to coat. Cover the pan and cook over a gentle heat for 15 minutes, until softened but not coloured.</li>
                <li>Stir in the stock and cider, bring up to the boil, then simmer for 15-20 minutes until the vegetables are just cooked.</li>
                <li>Blend the soup in 2 batches in a liquidiser until smooth, then season to taste. Return the soup to the pan and stir in 100ml of the cream.</li>
                <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high and gently re-heat the soup. Combine the grated cheese with the egg yolks, cider, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and some black pepper in a bowl. Place the slices of bread on a baking tray and grill until lightly toasted on both sides. Spread the cheese mixture on top and return to the grill until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Ladle the soup into bowls, swirl through the remaining cream and top with the chopped chives. Serve the Welsh rarebit croutes alongside.</li>
